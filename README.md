**Ethnic Group Identification from Text Classification Using Deep Learning**
This project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically Bi-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN models, for identifying ethnic groups based on textual data.

**Dataset:**
The dataset consists of text samples from various ethnic groups. It is pre-processed to remove stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant information.

**Model Architectures:**
1. **Bi-Directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM):**
   - Utilizes bidirectional LSTM layers to capture long-range dependencies in both directions.
   - Employs embedding layers to represent words as vectors.
   - Uses a global max pooling layer to extract the most important features.
   - A dense layer with softmax activation is used for classification.

2. **LSTM:**
   - Uses a single LSTM layer to process the text sequences.
   - Similar architecture to the Bi-LSTM model, but without the bidirectional layers.

3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
   - Uses convolutional layers to extract local features from the text sequences.
   - Employs max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
   - Flattens the output from the convolutional layers and feeds it into dense layers for classification.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

- The models are trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and the RMSprop optimizer.
- The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- ROC curves are plotted to visualize the performance of the models.

**Results:**
The Bi-LSTM model generally outperforms the LSTM and CNN models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics. However, the specific performance may vary depending on the dataset and hyperparameter tuning.

**Future Work:**
- Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to optimize model performance.
- Explore other deep learning architectures, such as transformers.
- Incorporate attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant parts of the text.
- Utilize advanced text preprocessing techniques like word embeddings and character-level embeddings.

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
